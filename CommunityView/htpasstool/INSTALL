To install, extract the tarball into a path accessible via your webserver, for instance

  /var/www/htpasstool

Make sure the directory is owned by the user your webserver runs as (e.g. www-data).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, edit the index.php file as follows.

1 Change the BASE_DIRECTORY constant to your liking. The htpasstool script
operates below this directory; in other words; if you put BASE_DIRECTORY to
/var/www/somewhere, htpasstool will only be able to manage .htaccess and
.htpasswd files in /var/www/somewhere/... It will not be able to manage
/var/www, or even /var/www/somewhereelse/.

2. If you changed BASE_DIRECTORY, you are probably going to want to modify the
$url_prefix variable too. See inside the index.php file for an explanation of
what this variable does.

3. If you intend to use the password reset/assign e-mail functionality, also
set/modify $admin_email, $template_subject and $template_body to your liking.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now surf to the htpasstool directory on your webserver.

If you don't have .htpasswd/.htaccess files yet in that directory, start by
adding a user, and then protect the directory.

At this point, you are set up. You can use htpasstool to manage .htpasswd files
across your webspace.
